----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the version of the software that was previously
downloadable from 2013-2022 from a series of LLNL institutional
webpages. Those webpages are now gone. The software is now
being set up for download from both GitHub and the LLNL Seaborg
Institute. This will be the case for all related software. The
Seaborg Institute site will contain additional materials of
interest.

This version of the software was developed with support from
the Yucca Mountain Project and the WIPP Project.

                    FURTHER INFORMATION

This software is provided in two download packages. One is for
Windows PC systems, the other for Linux systems. The Windows PC package works on Windows systems from Windows 7 through 10. It probably works on Windows 11, but that has not yet been tested.
The Windows package includes source code, executable files, data files, various text files addressing installation and use of the software, an extensive test case library, and code manuals (as
PDF documents). The Linux version is similar, but does not
include executable files. To create Linux executables, the user
must compile the provided source code. There are no "make" files
for this, but they are not really necessary. Installation
instructions for both download packages are contained in text
files with "install" in the names.
